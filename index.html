<h1>Boruto: Chapter 79</h1>
<p>The information in Boruto chapter 79 has made readers feel surprised. Chapter 79 has just been released, causing the Anime and Manga fan community to stir up because of the unexpected change to the previous plot from the series. There was criticism about the plot. There was nothing worth watching, but in this chapter, the author suddenly turned around, making the series extremely attractive. This made fans and those who had not followed Boruto all admire and praise. Now let's find out what happened. In recent chapters, everyone in the village started to panic because they couldn't feel it. It must be Naruto and Hinata's. It turned out that Kawaki was holding Naruto and Hinata captive. In a dimension where time has no effect, Boruto immediately went to find Kawaki, ignoring Asia's warning of danger from Kawaki. Here, the fierce battle of those who once considered each other brothers began. Sarada joined in and tried to stop Kawaki, but she failed. Right at the moment Kawaki wanted to kill Sanda. Boruto jumped in to shield her and he had an injury right in the eye before Boruto was seriously injured, Sasuke Chikamaru Corona had appeared at the battle Chikamaru used the shadow binding technique to hold Kawaki back Mitsuki tied Kawaki's arm tightly so that nothing bad could happen. The angry statement drew out his sword and aimed at Kawaki's neck to ask him not to move. However, Momoshiki suddenly took control of Boruto and attacked everyone. From there, it gave Kawaki a chance to escape. Finally, Momoshiki told Boruto that everything in his dream about the destruction of Konoha at the beginning of the manga was about to come true. In chapter 79, which started with Boruto holding his seriously injured eye, Chicamaru immediately ordered everyone there to disperse to search for Kawaki. Boruto told Sahara that the hacker was with Mitsuki and he himself had no problem. In another development, Kawaki used all his strength to escape while trying to erase traces of Chakura in the hope that there was no who tracked his trail while running and erasing Chakra for a long time made kawaki exhausted and fainted but luckily for him the first person to find him was her who found him and the Sharingan eye when Adam appeared in front of kawaki she reassured him that both were on the same side kawaki with the desire to protect Naruto and change Boruto's position to become the son of Naruto Uzumaki this would also make Boruto become a person who lost everything this was the turning point that set the stage for Ada's incredible Power performance by using her hands to hold kawaki's face Ada radiated an electric current with divine power she changed history and changed the position of Boruto and kawaki Boruto became the enemy of Konoha for killing Naruto while kawaki took on the role of Naruto's son born and raised in Konoha after Ada's history changing power everyone including mitsuki considered Boruto an enemy It seems that momoshiki's prophecy about Boruto has come true come true mitsuki goes into sage mode and attacks Boruto Yes He is the enemy the vision that Boruto experienced in chapter 75 seems to be coming true however the interesting thing is that Sahara seems to be unaffected by Ada's power in the final details of chapter 79 Momoshiki explained the current situation to me that he is now the culprit responsible for his father's death it can be said that after reading Boruto chapter 79 we are all shocked by the sudden appearance of Ada and her ability to rewrite history Ada's divine power has completely changed the structure of the series opening a new era for the series that seemed to be gone.</p>
